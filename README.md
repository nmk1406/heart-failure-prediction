# Heart Failure Prediction

In this project, I have used Random Forest and Logistic Regression to predict who is at risk of heart failure.

## Detail of dataset

[Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) was created by combining different datasets already available independently but not combined before. In this dataset, 5 heart datasets are combined over 11 common features which makes it the largest heart disease dataset available so far for research purposes

- Age: age of the patient
- Sex: sex of the patient
- ChestPainType: chest pain type
- RestingBP: resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol: serum cholesterol
- FastingBS: fasting blood sugar
- RestingECG: resting electrocardiogram results
- MaxHR: maximum heart rate achieved
- ExerciseAngina: exercise-induced angina
- Oldpeak: oldpeak = ST
- ST_Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

Target variable is HeartDisease with 0 (normal) and 1 (heart failure). Normal is a negative class and heart failure is a positive class.
